Sadly because of the use of external images and music sounds, there might be a problem with loading 
the game by simply pressing the index.html file. 
I succeeded with this approach using apache, but that might not be a good solution for the regular user.
Just to clarify - I had no problem with running the files from my developing platform - WebStorm.

I decided to use Github pages to provide a working link for the game, you can find it below, or a shortcut in
the main folder.
I hope it'd be enough.
Thank you and have fun exploring the minigame! :)
